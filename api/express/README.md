Scaffold for ExpressJS REST backend.

> Now this is going to be fun!  I'm going to avoid Typescript for this project to explore modern JavaScript (ES2021) in Node.js.

## What's Working

- ExpressJS REST
- TypeORM (because Sequelize doesn't do Javascript)
- PassportJS
    - With Google Authentication
    - With Microsoft Authentication
